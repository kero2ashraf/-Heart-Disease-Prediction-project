# -Heart-Disease-Prediction-project

In this project , i am talking about heart disease prediction , the summary of this project is to predict the heart disease based on 10 years CHD 



python packages :
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplolib.pyplot
4) seaborn
5) from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
6) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
7) from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
8) from sklearn.metrics import classification_report , confusion_matrix , accuracy_score
9) from sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix as PCM
    
My steps :
1) data overview
2) data cleaning
3) statistical inference
4) analysis of the data cleaning
5) EDA visualization
6) pictorial analysis
7) Normalization
8) train test split
9) Evaluating trained models
10) visualize the predicted label


questions :

1) Give an statistical summary about the data?
2) Check if there is any missing values ?
3) Get in every column the percentage of the missing value?
4) Analyse this missing values by getting the mean ?
5) Make a heatmap about the data by using correlation?
6) Make a pie chart to see the percentage of the Ten Year CHD of 1 and 0 ?
7) Make subplots about male and age and current smoker and cigs per day , heart rate and diaBp columns?
8) Make a pairplot about "age","cigsPerDay","totChol","sysBP","diaBP","BMI","heartRate","glucose" columns?
9) Make a data normalization and get x and y to make the model?
10) train the model with x and y and get the test by using logistic regression?
11) Get the accuracy ( train and test) to our model?
12) Get the probability of our model ?
13) plot the logistic regression accuracy ?
14) Make a PCM about True label and predicted label ?
